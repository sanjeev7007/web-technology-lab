# Experiment No: 2  
## Creation of a Web Page with All Types of Cascading Style Sheets

### Aim  
To create a web page using all types of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

### Software Used  
- Dreamweaver / Notepad / VS Code  
- Web Browser  

### Description  
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control the presentation and layout of
HTML elements in a web page. CSS allows styling of background colors, fonts,
text alignment, spacing, borders, and layout.

There are three types of CSS:

1. **Inline CSS**  
   - CSS styles are applied directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute.

2. **Internal (Embedded) CSS**  
   - CSS rules are written inside the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

3. **External CSS**  
   - CSS rules are written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

This experiment demonstrates the use of CSS to design and style multiple web
pages with improved appearance and layout.

### Algorithm  

**Internal CSS**  
1. Create an HTML file.  
2. Define CSS styles inside the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.  
3. Apply styles to HTML elements.  
4. Run the program in a web browser.

**External CSS**  
1. Create a separate file with `.css` extension.  
2. Write the required CSS rules in the file.  
3. Link the CSS file to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.  
4. Run the program in a web browser.

### Files Included  
- index.html (Main page with navigation)  
- jasmine.html  
- lilly.html  
- lotus.html  
- rose.html  
- Image folder  

### Result  
A web page using all types of Cascading Style Sheets was successfully created.
The styles were applied correctly, improving the visual appearance and layout
of the web pages.
