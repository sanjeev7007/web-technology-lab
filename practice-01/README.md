# Practice – Interactive College Image Map

## Aim
To create an interactive web page using an image map on a college layout
and display detailed information about selected buildings.

## Software Used
- Notepad / VS Code  
- Web Browser  

## Description
An image map allows different regions of a single image to act as hyperlinks.
Hotspots are defined using coordinates, and each hotspot redirects the user
to a separate HTML page containing relevant information.

In this practice exercise, a college top view image is used to create
hotspots for different buildings such as the Indoor Stadium and
Polytechnic Block.

HTML elements used:
- `<img>` to display the image
- `<map>` to define the image map
- `<area>` to create clickable hotspots

## Files Included
- index.html (College map page)
- indoor.html (Indoor Stadium information page)
- poly.html (Polytechnic Block information page)
- Images folder

## Result
The interactive college image map was successfully created.
Clicking on each building opens its respective information page,
and navigation works correctly.
